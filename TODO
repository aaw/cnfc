* Add several more examples
  * rubiks cube: given a state, return a solution of length n
* Write READMEs for examples
* Redo unit propagation so there's not two *Formula classes
  * Formula should take a config that enables simplifications
  * just do unit accumulation by default and stop accumulating if there are too many units
* Actually do log-depth addition accumulation in tuple_add
* Rename generate_var, generate_cnf to evaluate*
* Add more preprocessing
  * subsumption for clauses of length >= 2
  * ?
* Implement very simple clause caching/suppressing duplicate clauses
* Support cardinality constraints compared to one another:
  NumTrue(x,y,z) >= NumFalse(w,v)
* Support cardinality constraints as variable additions:
  Implies(NumTrue(x,y,z) > 1, NumFalse(w,v) > 0)
* Implement a parsing pass that puts expressions into a canonical form so we can
  cache/reuse them if they reoccur in other subexpressions
* Generate a bash script for sat generation/solving/extracting

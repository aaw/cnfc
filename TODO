* Write README for main
* Write READMEs for examples
* Add several more examples
  * rubiks cube: given a state, return a solution of length n?
* Better multiplication than just repeated addition, re-try ladner-fischer
* Rename generate_var, generate_cnf to evaluate*
* Implement very simple clause caching/suppressing duplicate clauses
* Support cardinality constraints compared to one another:
  NumTrue(x,y,z) >= NumFalse(w,v)
* Support cardinality constraints as variable additions:
  Implies(NumTrue(x,y,z) > 1, NumFalse(w,v) > 0)
* Implement a parsing pass that puts expressions into a canonical form so we can
  cache/reuse them if they reoccur in other subexpressions
* Generate a bash script for sat generation/solving/extracting

* Extract common unittest helpers
* Write comments in the DIMACS file header that list variable name to ID
  associations.
* Add some specializations in cardinality.py for 'at most 1 true' and 'at least
  one true'.
* Support cardinality constraints compared to one another:
  NumTrue(x,y,z) >= NumFalse(w,v)
* Support cardinality constraints as variable additions:
  Implies(NumTrue(x,y,z) > 1, NumFalse(w,v) > 0)
* Implement a parsing pass that puts expressions into a canonical form so we can
  cache/reuse them if they reoccur in other subexpressions

* Better way to deal with Integers: easier construction and printing (bin2int)
* Better multiplication than just repeated addition, re-try ladner-fischer
* Rename generate_var, generate_cnf to evaluate*
* Implement very simple clause caching/suppressing duplicate clauses
* Support integer division/subtraction by re-arranging parse tree into addition/multiplication
* Support cardinality constraints compared to one another:
  NumTrue(x,y,z) >= NumFalse(w,v). And to Integer: NumTrue(x,y,z) > Integer(1)
* Generate a bash script for sat generation/solving/extracting
* Replace cnfc/tests/dpll.py with a cdcl python solver. Some more complicated encodings like
  IsPalindrome are too tough for just dpll.
* Implement IsPrime predicate using Pratt certificates, drop into jane st. number cross 4
